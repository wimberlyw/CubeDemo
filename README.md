# CubeDemo
Unity Demo Cube Challenge assignment: 

Modify the cube.cs script so that at least two changes to the cube's behavior are made. Some things that you can consider doing:
Change the cube's location (transform)
Change the cube's scale
Change the angle at which the cube rotates - I DID THIS USING LEFT AND RIGHT ARROWS
Change the cube’s rotation speed - ""
Change the cube’s material color - USE THE SPACE BAR TO CHANGE COLORS
Change the cube’s material opacity
 
If you're feeling confident, try to accomplish the following as well!
Modify any of the changes above so they change randomly each time the scene is played.
Add extra functionality to the cube. For example, how might you change the color of the cube over time?
